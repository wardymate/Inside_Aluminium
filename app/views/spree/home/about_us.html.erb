        <h2>About Us</h2><br>
        <p style='font-size: 14px'>
          The combination of a high quality product range and first class service has been the recipe for success for Inside Aluminium for over 20 years.<br><br>

          We offer a large range of aluminium products in a unique choice of anodised colours and finishes.<br><br>

          Our products are likely to be found in the highest quality retail environments including department stores and utilised by a large number of the leading cosmetic brands.
          The availability of a vast range of colour finishes allows clients to have a strong brand image.<br><br>

          Although ideally suited to high end retail settings the versatility of the product range has resulted in use in varying environments and specification by leading designers and architects.<br><br>

          In addition to locations such as Harrods, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and leading department stores, products are used by jewellery stores, many high street retailers and airport duty free areas.
          There is really no situation to which our products are not suited within the leisure, entertainment and hospitality industries including hotels, cinemas, casinos, night clubs, restaurants, exhibitions and even cruise liners.
          There would be many other applications within the commercial and domestic sectors.
